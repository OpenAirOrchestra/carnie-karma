A plugin to calculate and display participation Karma for The Carnival Band

== Description ==

Calculate a Karma rating based on participation in Carnival Band
Workshops and Gigs.  Karma is based on participation, with a
decay factor with a half life of about a year, so recent particpation
is what matters most.  But what have you done for me lately?

This plugin depends upon the carnig-gigs plugin and the
workshop-attendance plugin.  It extracts data from the
tables those plugins use.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the carnie-gigs wordpress plugin.
2. Install and activate the workshop-attendance wordpress plugin.
3. Upload this plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
5. Put the shortcode [carniekarma] somewhere on your website.
